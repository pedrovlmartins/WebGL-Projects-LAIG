# First project

The first project consists of a small 3D graphical parser capable of reading XML files describing a scene. The parsed information is then converted to an actual scene in WebGL. The created scene is a marlboro cigarette pack.

# Second project

The second project consists of an extension to the first project with a few more functionalities, such as animations and the use of shaders to create a color moving effect on selected objects. The scene in WebGL was also extended with more objects to showcase these features to the user.
